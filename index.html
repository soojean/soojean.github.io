          <h2 align="center"> Welcome to my personal website. </h2>

          <p> I am an assistant professor at <a href="https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/">KAIST School of Electrical Engineering</a>, and the director of the <a href="http://acss.kaist.ac.kr/">Autonomous Control for Stochastic Systems (ACSS) Lab</a>.
          My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of control theory and artificial intelligence.
          Some applications we study are stochastic systems, distributed sensing, and decision-making networks.
