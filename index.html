          <h2 align="center"> Welcome to my website! </h2>

          <p> I am a postdoctoral scholar with the <a href="http://aerospacerobotics.caltech.edu/"> Autonomous Robotics and Control Lab</a> at <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/">Caltech</a>.
          I completed my Ph.D. in <a href="http://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/grad_cds">Control and Dynamical Systems</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~doyle/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">Professor John C. Doyle</a> and <a href="http://aerospacerobotics.caltech.edu/prof-soonjo-chung">Professor Soon-Jo Chung</a>.
          My thesis, entitled <i>Control and State-Estimation of Jump Stochastic Systems by Learning Recurrent Spatiotemporal Patterns</i>, can be read <a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/15094/">here</a>. 
          Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree in <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/">Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/">Applied Mathematics</a> at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a> in Fall 2016.

          <p> My research broadly deals with efficient control for non-Gaussian stochastic systems which have jump phenomena, such as Poisson shot noise perturbations and hybrid dynamical systems.
          <!-- especially jump phenomena which are a sequence of random variables that occur as repeated patterns.  -->
          My research targets applications in large-scale network systems, fault-tolerance, and aerospace robotics (e.g., swarm intelligence) where systems are often modeled with recurrent jump patterns. 
          <!-- My research areas of interest are in probability and stochastic processes, stochastic control, , and , and machine learning. -->
          I am also interested in learning-based estimation and control algorithms that take advantage of a system's patterns over space (e.g., topological symmetries) and over time, such as distributed network control and graph convolutional neural networks.
          </p>
